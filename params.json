I am certified in a wide range of fitness programs, including Silver Sneakers, Yoga, Bombay Jam, and Zumba. In addition to my pursuit of a healthy lifestyle, I have an undergraduate degree in Architecture, a Masters in Psychology, and I am working on my Nutritionist certification! \r\n\r\nMy experiences have taught me that the journey towards a healthy lifestyle is both a rewarding and personal one. I know we expect to change physically when we work out, but we also improve our mental health! Together, we are going to bring an awareness that will change your heart, mind and body towards healthy living; I want you to think total body evolution! It is very much a process, so having compassion for yourself and believing that you are worth the effort is critical. It is never too late to invest in yourself! \r\n### ## **Certifications**\r\n* AFAA Group Exercise Instructor__\r\n* Silver Sneakers\r\n* Bombay Jam\r\n* Zumba Fitness\r\n### **Class Schedule**\r\n* Monday: Bombay Jam @ Athletic Garage, 6:30pm-7:30pm (Pasadena)\r\n* Wednesday: Bombay Jam @ LA Live Arts, 5:30pm-6:30pm (Eagle Rock)\r\n* Thursday: Zumba @ Advanced Bionics, 5:10pm-6:10pm (Santa Clarita)\r\n* Sunday: Bollywood-Zumba @ Bella Fitness, 10:15am-11:15am, Yoga @ Bella Fitness 11:30am-12:30pm (Glendale)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
